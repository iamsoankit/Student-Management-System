# Student-Management-System
This Python project aims to simplify the process of managing student information, such as their name, school, address, and contact details. The system allows users to add, delete, and update student information, reducing the need for manual data entry.

This project was created as part of the CBSE Class XII Computer Science curriculum during the 2020-2021 academic year

The GUI application has a window with a title "Management" and an icon photo i.e icon.png . It has a label with the text "Student Management System" displayed in the center of the window

As part of the project, we utilized several tools and technologies to develop the application. We used the MySQL Connector/Python module to establish a connection between the Python program and the MySQL database. This allowed us to retrieve and store student information in the database.

In addition, we used the Tkinter library, which is a standard GUI toolkit for Python, to design and create the user interface of the application. Tkinter provides a set of graphical widgets, such as buttons, labels, and text boxes, that we used to create a user-friendly interface for managing student records.

Overall, the combination of MySQL Connector/Python and Tkinter enabled us to build an efficient and effective student management system that simplifies the management of student details.

## Features
- Add new students to the system
- Update existing student information
- Delete students from the system
- View a list of all students and their details


## Getting Started 

To get started with the Student Management System, simply download or clone the repository using Git Bash and run the ABC.py file. The system is built using Python 3 and requires no additional libraries or dependencies.
